# search4letters-on-the-web v1.0
 - Creator (developer) does not guarantee you that this program will work and anything like that.
 - This program is being shared only under the Apache 2.0 license.
 - The developer is not guilty if any harm was made using this program and so on.

#### Files
 - The code of HTML pages in the 'templates' folder.
 - The css styles data is in the 'static' folder.
 - search4letters.log is the logging file of the webapp.
 - search4web.py is the main code of the app.

To start the program, you should launch it on the one of web-hosting services first. 
For instance, I used the one called "PythonAnywhere" (https://www.pythonanywhere.com).
You can watch on YouTube how to use it.
